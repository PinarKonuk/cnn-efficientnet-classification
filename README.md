# CNN and Transfer Learning with EfficientNet

## üìã Project Description

This project demonstrates image classification using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and EfficientNet with transfer learning. The primary goal is to classify animal images into 10 categories from the Animals-10 dataset. The project involves two parts:

* Custom CNN Model: A CNN built from scratch with six convolutional layers and dropout regularization.

* Transfer Learning with EfficientNet: Fine-tuning a pre-trained EfficientNet model to adapt to the dataset.

## üöÄ Features

* Custom CNN architecture with detailed training and validation steps.

* Implementation of dropout layers to improve generalization.

* Transfer learning with EfficientNet using two approaches:

* Training only the fully connected (FC) layer.

* Training the last two convolutional blocks and the FC layer.

* Visualization of training metrics (loss and accuracy).

* Evaluation using confusion matrices and comparison of results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* Python: Programming language

* PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building and training models

* NumPy: Numerical computations

* Matplotlib: Visualization of training metrics

* scikit-learn: Evaluation metrics and utilities
